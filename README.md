# codeprint

Auto-generate markup examples for your styleguide.

If you like to handcraft your styleguides, but don't like to handcraft the code examples then this script is for you.

Similar to the excellent <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/X-rayHTML">xrayhtml</a>, though codeprint doesn't do any snazy flip to reveal shenanigans and requires you to write your own css styles.

## GitHub Pages
This is the readme for the gh-pages branch, which contains a promotional site with demos of how to use codeprint. Full install and usage details for codeprint are provided in the readme in the master branch.


### Working on the github pages site

The website uses sass:

    gulp watch

Will listen for changes and recompile the css.
